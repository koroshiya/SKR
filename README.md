SKR
===

This game, which as of yet has no name, currently uses characters based on Sun-Ken Rock.
It is a fan-made game using such characters as a basis for development and will by no means center around the series.

SKR is now built on the slick2d java gaming library, a free and open source project.
You can learn more about the project here: http://slick.ninjacave.com/

Sprites were made by Peter Hull.
